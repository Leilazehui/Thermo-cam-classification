## Preparation prior to the AI model training

**Equipment**: Hikimicro Thermographic network box camera, computer, 6-axis Ure5 robotic arm
**Software**: Cognex, Roboflow

**Description**:
- Perform auto-operation of the robotic arm which is pre-setup in Cognex
- Record the images captured on the thermographic camera at different temperature range
- Annotate the captured images on Roboflow to classify each joint and arm of the robotic arm and categorize them into "train, validate and test" images
- Train the AI model
